 refactoring the LanguageBatchBo

## PHP Fejlesztői kiválasztási folyamathoz kapcsolódó feladatleírás

### Task:
Your task is to refactor the LanguageBatchBo.
The solution will be evaluated based on the following goals:
- Keep the original functionality.
- Increase the inner code quality.

### Rules:

- Create local git repository for the project.
- Commit after each coding step, when the system is in working condition.
- The interface of the LanguageBatchBo can't be changed (the generate_language_files.php should remain the same), but (of course) it's content can change and it can be split into new classes.
- The ApiCall, and Config classes are mock/simplified versions of the original dependencies, they can not be changed.
- The error message of the exceptions can be simplified.
- The console output of the script doesn't have to be the same as in the original version.
- You can upgrade code and dependencies to PHP 7.4
- Inline comments are not necessary.
